## Heya, my name is Azzy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 17 y/o self-taught developer focused on back-end and game development!



## What I'm Currently Doing ðŸ”­

- Previously I have made contributions to both the development and community/support side at a small development group known as ChatHigh. A group focusing on the development of numerous Discord support-bots.

- Currently I am not focused on any major projects. I love to learn more about computer science, so I've been recently taking a few courses to strenghten my knowledge in the field!

## Developer Stack ðŸ“š

- I'd like to say I'm a decent enough programmer, though I'm a little off of my goal for being a full-stack developer. Below I've listed all languages/programs I am familiar with!

## Reach Me! ðŸ“ž

Currently I do not have an email for public use! So for the time being you can always contact me on Discord.
